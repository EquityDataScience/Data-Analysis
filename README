2-Hour Challenge — Chat with Your Data

Build a simple chat app where a user uploads a CSV or Excel file and can ask natural-language questions (e.g. “total sales by store”, “correlation matrix”, “which stock had the highest return in 2024?”).

Requirements
	•	Upload CSV/XLSX (supporting one is enough)
	•	Accept questions in plain text
	•	Return results to the user (table, number, or chart)
	•	Time between receipt of this repo and your final commit must be ≤ 2 hours

What We’re Looking For
We want to see:
	•	Problem-solving skills
	•	Clever solutions
	•	Working code

We’re not looking for perfection—this is about aptitude.

How to Submit
	•	Push your solution to your own personal repo (public or private).
	•	Send us the link when you’re done.
